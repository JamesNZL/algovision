# Power

- Batteries
- Voltage regulator(s) for supply rails
- Boost converter for LEDs?
- Battery voltage sensing
- Power LED

# User Input

- User pushbuttons
	- How is the user expected to select each mode/algorithm?

# Display

- LED matrix/display
	- Ideally want RGB supportâ€”want to have RGB rainbows etc
		- This only really works with an LED matrix though, an RGB rainbow on an LCD/OLED display is boring
- Shift registers if required
 
# Microcontroller/Programming

- Microcontroller
- USB connector
- USB to serial interface chip
- Debug LEDs
