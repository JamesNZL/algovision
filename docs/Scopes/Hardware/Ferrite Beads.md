# Ferrite Beads

As I have not used ferrite beads before, I want to first understand how to use them properly & select an appropriate part.

I will begin by using [[LTspice]] to analyse an equivalent model.

I see that the ferrite bead acts as type of band-reject filter, where it attenuates high-frequency signals until the reactance of the parallel capacitor dominates and begins to act as a short circuit.
