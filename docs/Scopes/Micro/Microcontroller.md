# Microcontroller

To choose my microcontroller, I will first start by clearly defining the various [[Requirements|requirements]] that I must satisfy in order to drive my [[Display|display]] and control the various [[Interface|interface]] components.

I know that I will want to consider at least the various ESP devices like the [[ESP32]] and [[ESP8266]], and also the [[PSoC 6]] after having used a PSoC 5 in [COMPSYS 301](https://docs.jamesnzl.xyz/compsys301-pathfinding-robot). I will also want to consider a few [[STM32]] microcontrollers, so I can become more familiar with these for industry.

In my decision making, I will want to primarily consider, amongst other things:

- Required peripherals,
- Core widths,
- Cost,
- Stock availability (likely a *big* factor!), and
- Clock frequency.
