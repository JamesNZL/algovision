# Power Connector

I want a dedicated, stand-alone [[USB Type-C Connectors|USB Type-C connector]] purely to supply the power for my [[PCB]], which is to be connected to a capable [[USB Power Delivery]] source. This connector will need to be connected on my board to a [[USB-C Configuration Controller]] or [[USB Power Delivery Control Peripheral]] to correctly negotiate the required USB-C/PD power rules from the source.
