# USB Type-C Connectors

In this project, I envisage having two separate USB Type-C connectors, one for [[Power Connector|power]] and one for [[Data Connector|data]] (eg programming).

I will need to carefully consider how this is implemented, as these two connectors have very separate concernsâ€”the power connector is to be plugged into a [[USB Power Delivery]] source to supply the LEDs, whilst the data connector is for [[Programming]] and debugging.
