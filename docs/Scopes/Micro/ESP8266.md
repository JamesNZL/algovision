## Notes

- Tensilica L106 RISC processor
- Includes on-chip [[IEEE 802.11]] `b/g/n` WiFi with TCP/IP software and BLE
- 'The RTOS and WiFi stack allow about 80% of the processing power to be available for user application programming'

- 32-bit
- Up to $160\,\text{MHz}$
- No in-built flash memory, but the `ESP8285` does have $1\,\text{MiB}$
- $160\,\text{kiB}$ total RAM, memory hierarchy includes an I-cache

- $3.3\,\text{V}$
- 1x 10-bit SAR ADC
- 17 GPIO pins

## Conclusions

> [!fail]
> Although it would be neat to have a one-chip solution that solves my [[Connectivity|connectivity]] implementation(s), the lack of thorough documentation/support (at least once you depart from Arduino IDE-compatible libraries) is concerning.
> 
> Further, I think I would better achieve the [[1 —  Goals|goals]] of creating a project that demonstrates my abilities/better prepares me for industry by selecting a microcontroller (and architecture) that is more commonly used in industry (at least, as more than just a WiFi module)—eg an ARM-architecture [[STM32]].
