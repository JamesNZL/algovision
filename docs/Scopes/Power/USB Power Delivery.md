# USB Power Delivery

- Will almost definitely be able to provide sufficient power (up to $20\,\text{V}$, $5\,\text{A}$)
- Gives users the freedom to power from any USB PD supply (which I can reasonably expect them to have)
- Can be used portably with a USB PD power bank
- User friendly USB C interface
- Reverse polarity etc probably isn't needed?
