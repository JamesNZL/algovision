# USB Power Delivery

- Will almost definitely be able to provide sufficient power (up to $20\,\text{V}$, $5\,\text{A}$)
- Gives users the freedom to power from any USB PD supply (which I can reasonably expect them to have)
- Can be used portably with a USB PD [[Batteries|power bank]]
- User friendly [[Scopes/Micro/USB Connector|USB C interface]]
- [[Scopes/Power/Reverse Polarity Protection]] etc probably isn't needed?
