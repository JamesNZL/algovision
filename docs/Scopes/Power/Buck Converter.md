# Buck Converter

- I think it will be better if I use a discrete IC, rather than using an internal SMPS in my [[STM32]] [[Microcontroller]]?
	- Physical spacing of the fast-switching & magnetic elements
	- Get some familiarity with a discrete part

- Do I even need a buck converter, or should I just use a [[Low Dropout Regulator]]? I'm only going from $5\,\text{V}\to3.3\,\text{V}$...
