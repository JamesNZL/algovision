# Batteries

- Want something low-profile, preferably mountable directly to the PCB
	- Coin cells/button batteries, but these are likely to be too low voltage/capacity to drive the LEDs/displays
	- Standard AA(A)/9V?
	- Li-Po batteries?
		- Could get bulky/difficult to charge/less user-friendly (as less common/readily available than alternatives)

> Could use a [[USB Power Delivery]] power bank!
