# Current Sensing

I want to be able to sense the current being drawn from my [[USB Power Delivery]] source through the [[Power Connector]].

This will require a [[Shunt Resistor]] and an [[Operational Amplifier]] circuit, which will then be fed into an ADC on my [[Microcontroller]].

> Also have a look at 'current sense amplifiers' on Digi. There's a whole category of fixed-gain inamps designed for the task
