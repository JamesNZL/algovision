# Display

Potential options include an LED matrix, an LCD/OLED/other display, ...

## LED Matrix

### Pros
- Likely the simplest to implement in hardware/firmware (without external libraries)
- Can easily understand/communicate how it works
- Would have the prettiest RGB rainbow animations

### Cons
- Lots of individual components for a medium-large matrix...
- Cost?
- Power drawâ€”unsure of how power-hungry the other options are, but I expect this to be more power-hungry than a off-the-shelf display module
- Far inferior pixel density/resolution

## LCD



## OLED
