# Goals

> [!NOTE]  
> This document lists the goals and outcomes that this project should aim to accomplish.

---

1. To complete a project that envelops hardware, firmware, and (possibly) software design

2. To revise data structures/[[algorithms]] and visualise common [[sorting]] and [[pathfinding]]/[[search]] algorithms in an easily-understood manner

3. To revise [[Scopes/Micro/Microcontroller|microcontroller]] concepts and available peripherals—eg timers/counters, GPIOs, serial communication, shift registers/multiplexing for matrix displays, etc.

4. To (finally) follow one of my own [[PCB]] designs through to fabrication/assembly/seeing it work

5. To complete a project that is self-contained and accessible—ideally should not require any extraneous equipment—eg no special load/supply/test environment/etc.

6. To learn about the [[USB]] protocol

7. To learn more about another microcontroller—possibly the [[ESP8266]]/[[ESP32]], or maybe a [[PSoC 6]]

8. To have something else that I can show off to demonstrate my knowledge and design ability

9. To have something that other students could potentially use to help learn about different algorithms

10. To apply my existing understanding of electronics and analogue design and build my confidence, whilst diving deeper and learning new concepts

11. To test my understanding of how [[Display|displays]]/matrices are driven

12. To have something to help show off Electrical/Computer Engineering!!!

13. To understand and design how [[Boost Converter|buck/boost converters]] work—if applicable

14. To write as much of my own driver firmware as possible, rather than relying on external/3rd party libraries
